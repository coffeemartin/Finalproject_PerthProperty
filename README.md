This is the final project of the Python Course (CoderAcademy) 

Structure of the project.

1. Summery 

In order to successfully purchase an ideal house, it is very important to firstly have an overview of local property market. It could be a very daunting task to accomplish when we have very few knowledge or no direction. There are thousands of houses for sell each day, where should we start?  By using a real data set downloaded from Kaggle, it will help us gain some understanding of the differences between house prices, suburbs, land sizes, then therefore having a direction to understand the market further.

2. Data

The dataset was gained from the website Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/syuzai/perth-house-prices It was originally scraped from http://house.speakingsame.com/ and it includes data from 322 Perth suburbs.

3. Result

After cleaning, re-coding, analyze the data, I have managed to visualise a few key factors from the data set, such as : price, location, and house conditions. I then have found my 'entry points' - A list of suburbs fits in my budget, my preference of the suburbss. I have then selected my first prefered suburb based on the price, location and popularity of the sells, and finally successfully visualised all the data infomation of that suburb on a real map, with pop up windows to allow me gain all the detailed information of each house.
