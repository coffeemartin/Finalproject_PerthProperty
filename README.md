This is the final project of the Python Course (CoderAcademy) 

Structure of the project.

1. Summery 

In order to successfully purchase a ideal house, it is very important to have a overview of local property market. It could be very daunting when we have very few knowledge or have no directions.There are thousands of houses for sell each day, where should we start?  By using a real data set downloaded from Kaggle, it can help us gain some understanding of the differences between prices, suburbs, houses, then therefore having a direction to further comparing or inspecting the houses.

2. Data

The dataset was gained from the website Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/syuzai/perth-house-prices It was originally scraped from http://house.speakingsame.com/ and includes data from 322 Perth suburbs.

3. Result

After anaylysing, re-organising, and cleaning the data, I have managed to visualise a few key factors amongest all the houses, such as : price and location. I then have found my 'entry points' - A list of suburbs fits in my budget, my preference of the locations. Finally I have selected my first prefered suburbs based on the popularity of the suburbs, and successfully visualised all the data entires from that suburb onto a map.
